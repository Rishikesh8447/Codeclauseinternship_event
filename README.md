# Event Management System (Java GUI Project)

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This is a simple **Event Management System** built using **Java Swing**.  
It allows users to:
- **Add Events** (Name, Date, Location)
- **View All Events**
- **Search for an Event** by name
- **Delete an Event**
- **Clear the Output Area**

All data is stored **temporarily** in memory (using `ArrayList`) during the program run.
